# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and
this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Entries record *what changed and why it mattered*. Where a change closes a
security hole or corrects an earlier mistake, it says so — the detailed reasoning
lives in the commit message, and the design rationale in
[`docs/internal/`](docs/internal/).

## [Unreleased]

Two rounds of the same lesson. First, running the documented commands end to end
— rather than reading them — found six defects the 397-test suite could not see.
Then publishing the vault behind an OAuth server, and attacking it, found
nineteen more in code that was one commit old. Every one lived in a seam between
layers that were each individually correct and individually tested.

### Added — public deployment

- **OAuth 2.1 authorization server** (`whatsvault.mcp.oauth`, `oauth_http`),
  mounted only when `WHATSVAULT_PUBLIC_URL` is set. ChatGPT's connector dialog
  offers OAuth, No Authentication or Mixed, so a static bearer token fits none of
  them and reaching the vault from ChatGPT needs an authorization server. RFC
  8414 / 9728 metadata, RFC 7591 dynamic client registration, PKCE `S256` only,
  exact-match https redirect URIs, single-use 60-second codes, rotating refresh
  tokens, SHA-256 hashing of every code and token at rest.
- **Out-of-band approval.** The consent page has no form and no password field;
  it shows a code and polls. `whatsvault oauth-pending`, `oauth-approve` and
  `oauth-revoke` are the only way a grant is ever made. A public form accepting a
  secret is a phishing and brute-force target, and approval here belongs on a
  channel the requester cannot reach — the same reason sending needs the phone.
- `whatsvault accounts-add`, `accounts-list`, `conversations-add`,
  `conversations-list`. `import` refuses to guess its target, but nothing created
  an account or conversation, so the IDs it demands could not be obtained and the
  documented import was unreachable on every new vault.
- `tests/conftest.py`: fails any test that writes to the operator's real vault.
- `tests/test_docs_match_code.py`: CI now asserts that the live docs describe the
  code that exists — every documented CLI verb is registered, every registered MCP
  tool is documented, the forbidden set the README names really is forbidden,
  every variable in `.env.example` is read somewhere, and relative links resolve.
  Doc drift here has not been cosmetic: four documented verbs never existed,
  `USAGE.md` printed an account id nothing could produce, and `.env.example`
  offered two variables no code path has ever read.
- Live-transport tool tests, and two adversarial suites for the OAuth grant
  machinery and for what changes by publishing.

### Fixed

- **Every database-backed MCP tool failed on the running server.** Connections
  are opened on the main thread; the SDK dispatches handlers onto a worker
  thread. Now opened with `check_same_thread=False` and serialised on one lock,
  with a thread-pinned connection refused at startup rather than turning every
  call into an opaque 500.
- **`search` had never worked over MCP.** The handler declared a `SearchQuery`
  parameter; a client sends JSON, so it arrived as a string and every call raised.
- **`whatsvault init` could not run**, and **never migrated an existing vault** —
  a shipped migration reached no database that already existed, so a live vault
  worked until a query hit `no such table`. `doctor` gained a `schema_current`
  check so the drift is never silent.
- **The launchd install pointed at a venv nothing created**, so `launchctl load`
  would spawn a missing binary.
- **`init` under-reported its own work**, naming two keys where it minted four —
  omitting the pair whose loss is unrecoverable.
- **DNS-rebinding protection rejected the published host**, so a correctly
  authenticated token still got `421`. Fixed by naming the host, never by
  weakening the check.
- Console scripts now resolve, and `main()` returns its exit code instead of
  raising `SystemExit`, which reported success for every failure.

### Security

- **The MCP result cap could be lifted with `limit: -1`** — SQLite treats
  `LIMIT -1` as unbounded, so one call could drain the table.
- **`get_conversation_window` took `now_ms` from the caller**, letting the model
  assert the time that decides whether a send window is open.
- **Every unauthenticated OAuth endpoint was unbounded** — `state`,
  `code_challenge` and `redirect_uris` were stored verbatim, so a loop of
  authorize calls wrote as much as the caller liked into the operator's database.
  Capped, throttled, and expired rows collected.
- **Grants were not audited.** Tool calls were; the grant authorising them was
  not, so after an incident there was no answer to "who was given access, and
  when".
- **Refresh rotation contained nothing** — the replaced access token stayed live
  for its full hour — and **reuse of a rotated refresh token only failed the
  call**, leaving the thief's newer pair working. The whole grant family is now
  revoked, per OAuth 2.1 §4.14.2.
- **The consent page escaped only `<`.** Now `html.escape` plus stripping
  Cf-category characters: a right-to-left override can make a hostile client name
  read as a familiar one in the sentence asking for consent. The page carries a
  CSP with `frame-ancestors 'none'`, `referrer-policy: no-referrer` so a code
  cannot leak in a `Referer`, and `nosniff`.
- OAuth discovery paths answer `404`, not the gate's `401` — clients parse an
  error body as protected-resource metadata.

### Documentation

- `.env.example` no longer offers `WHATSVAULT_MCP_HOST` and `WHATSVAULT_MCP_PORT`.
  No code path has ever read them, so setting them did nothing and gave no clue
  why. Removed rather than implemented: the loopback bind is a design property,
  not a default, and the file now says so and documents
  `WHATSVAULT_PUBLIC_URL`, which is read.
- README, ARCHITECTURE and SECURITY describe the published deployment: what the
  OAuth server is for, why the consent page accepts no secret, why the
  unauthenticated region cannot reach a tool, and the trade being made — content
  reaches a third party on every tool call, and the read-only surface bounds the
  model, not the host.
- The README's red-team section covers both rounds rather than only the first.

---

The 0.1.0 sections below record the first round.

### Added

- `whatsvault accounts-add`, `accounts-list`, `conversations-add` and
  `conversations-list`. `import` refuses to guess its target, but a fresh vault
  had no accounts and no conversations and no verb created either — so the
  `--conversation-id` and `--account-id` it demands could not be obtained by any
  means, and the documented import was unreachable on every new vault.
- `tests/conftest.py`: an autouse guard that points `$WHATSVAULT_HOME` at a
  per-test directory and fails any test that writes to the operator's real vault.
- `tests/test_mcp_transport_tools_live.py`: tool calls over a real socket. The
  existing live suite stopped at `initialize`, so no test had ever executed a
  handler that touches SQLCipher.

### Fixed

- **Every database-backed MCP tool failed on the running server.** Connections are
  opened once on the main thread; the SDK dispatches synchronous handlers onto a
  worker thread, so each call raised `SQLite objects created in a thread can only
  be used in that same thread`. Connections for the daemon are now opened with
  `check_same_thread=False` and every handler is serialised on one lock. A wrong
  flag is refused at startup, with the fix in the message, instead of turning each
  call into an opaque 500.
- **`search` had never worked over MCP.** The registered handler declared a
  `SearchQuery` parameter and passed it straight through; a client sends JSON, so
  the value arrived as a string and every call raised `AttributeError`. The unit
  tests missed it because they construct a `SearchQuery` in Python and call
  `reads.search` directly, bypassing the handler that is actually registered.
- **`whatsvault init` could not run.** `cli.main` opened both databases before
  dispatching, so on a fresh machine — the only place anyone runs `init` — it died
  with `KeyMissing` before argparse's verb reached the command table. Bootstrap
  verbs now run without connections, and a missing key reports `run
  \`whatsvault init\` first` rather than a traceback.
- **`cmd_init` resolved the vault layout from the environment**, not from the
  context it was handed, so a test injecting a temporary path still created a real
  `~/.whatsvault` — with keys in a keystore that vanished, leaving unreadable
  ciphertext that then blocked a genuine `init`. The layout now travels with the
  context.
- The console scripts `whatsvault` and `whatsvault-mcp` are asserted to resolve,
  and `main()` returns its exit code rather than raising `SystemExit` — setuptools
  wraps it in `sys.exit()`, so a `None` return reported success for every failure.

### Security

- **The MCP result cap could be lifted by asking for `limit: -1`.** SQLite treats
  `LIMIT -1` as unbounded, so `min(limit, MAX_LIMIT)` was not a cap and a single
  call could drain the whole table through the read surface. Clamped at both ends.
- **`get_conversation_window` took `now_ms` from the caller**, letting the model
  assert the time that decides whether a send window is open. The tool now takes
  `conversation_id` only and reads the server clock (INV-SENDPOLICY).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-08-28

First public release. The vault, search, and read-only MCP surface are complete
and tested. The write path is implemented but deliberately inert, gated behind
[Phase-0 verification](docs/internal/findings/2026-08-27-phase0-verification.md).

### Added

**Vault core**
- SQLCipher-encrypted `vault.db` (evidence) and `control.db` (control plane), keyed
  from the macOS Keychain, with eager key validation — `PRAGMA key` is lazy, so a
  wrong key would otherwise fail only on first page read.
- Forward-only migrations applied atomically; a failure rolls back and leaves the
  schema version unchanged.
- ULID-based prefixed identifiers, and triggers enforcing immutability of evidence
  fields.

**Import**
- WhatsApp text-export parser with an explicit grammar, provenance tracking, and
  exact undo by batch.
- Time modelled as **uncertainty intervals** rather than instants: a `14:32` line
  has minute precision in an unknown second, and DST-ambiguous or skipped local
  times are classified rather than silently resolved.
- Zip-bomb and path-traversal guards on archive input.

**Search**
- FTS5 over a normalised representation, tuned for mixed English/Persian text —
  ZWNJ handling and Arabic/Persian character folding.
- Two-tier ranking (lexical and compact) with snippet extraction.
- The index is explicitly derived and disposable: it can be dropped and rebuilt
  without affecting evidence, deduplication identity, or display.

**Read-only MCP surface**
- Six read tools over Streamable HTTP on loopback, each annotated
  `readOnlyHint: true`, `openWorldHint: false`.
- A **provably empty write surface**: CI asserts the registered tool set is
  disjoint from a named forbidden set, checked against plain module constants so
  the guarantee survives SDK changes.
- Bearer-token authentication in ASGI middleware, constant-time compared;
  DNS-rebinding protection with a pinned `Host`.
- Redaction (no full phone number ever leaves the boundary) and untrusted-content
  wrapping of every WhatsApp-originated string.
- A server-side `LOCAL_ONLY` visibility fence, settable only from the CLI or phone.
- Keyed-HMAC audit log — not a bare SHA-256, which would make a low-entropy query
  such as a contact name trivially recoverable by dictionary attack.

**Approval chain**
- Immutable drafts with single-use nonces and expiry; a shared policy engine runs
  at prepare and again authoritatively at send.
- Two-key device enrolment with mutual challenge, binding signing and agreement
  keys; P-256 ECDH device sealing for draft detail served to the phone.
- A display guard for bidi overrides, zero-width characters, and confusables —
  the signature binds bytes, but a human approves rendered glyphs.
- Crash-durable send state machine: a stranded `SUBMITTING` attempt resolves to
  `INDETERMINATE`, never a blind resend.

**Ingest**
- Sealed envelopes authenticating their own header as AEAD associated data, so
  metadata cannot be swapped or downgraded without failing the tag.
- Pull-consumer loop that acknowledges only after durable local disposition, with
  decrypt failures classified by key health — an isolated AEAD failure is poison
  and quarantined, a systemic one trips a circuit breaker.
- Dead-letter queue with sanitised metadata and no payload retention.

**Operations and CLI**
- `whatsvault init` — creates the runtime layout, both encrypted databases, all
  migrations, and every Keychain key.
- `import`, `import-undo`, `mcp-visibility`, `mcp-provision`, `doctor`, `health`,
  and device, DLQ, template, reconciliation, and scheduler verbs.
- A CLI surface with **no** approve, send, sign, or dispatch verb, asserted by test.
- Four launchd units, content-free structured logging, filesystem hardening
  (`0700` directories, `0600` secret files), and conservative startup recovery.

**Project infrastructure**
- README, architecture overview, usage guide, MCP reference, security policy,
  contribution guide, and code of conduct.
- CI running lint and format on Linux, the full suite on macOS across Python
  3.11–3.13, secret scanning over full history, and a build job that verifies the
  wheel ships both packages and both console scripts.
- ruff, coverage, pre-commit, EditorConfig, and a Makefile whose targets are the
  same commands CI runs.

### Fixed

- **Imported messages were never indexed**, so search over them silently returned
  nothing. With live ingest gated, import is the only way data enters the vault,
  meaning the primary read path had never worked end to end. `doctor` had been
  asserting this all along; unit tests masked it by indexing by hand in fixtures.
- **No way to create a vault existed.** `provision_db()` and the migration runner
  were tested but uncalled, while every entry point required databases nothing
  could produce.
- **All four launchd units were silent restart loops** — well-formed plists
  pointing at modules with no entry point, which under `KeepAlive: true` were
  imported, exited instantly, and restarted forever.
- MCP transport authentication was a *tool parameter*, publishing the server's own
  secret in every tool's JSON schema and unreachable over HTTP, where the token
  arrives in a header.
- A latent crash in the audit path: hashing a structured `SearchQuery` argument
  would raise mid-request. Only the no-argument tool had ever been exercised.
- Roughly twenty leaked file handles across the test suite, surfaced by promoting
  warnings to errors.

### Security

Findings from a red-team pass over the read surface, each now pinned by a
regression test in [`tests/adversarial/`](tests/adversarial/):

- **Privacy-fence bypass (high).** `get_conversation_window` ignored the
  `LOCAL_ONLY` fence, leaking exact last-inbound timestamps for conversations
  explicitly marked private. Activity timing is content.
- **Phone numbers recoverable through redaction (high).** Raw `wamid` values were
  returned unredacted, and a `wamid` base64-decodes to the counterparty's full
  E.164 — defeating contact masking for every reply. Replaced with opaque,
  correlatable handles.
- **Row-limit escape (medium).** `min(limit, MAX_LIMIT)` admits negatives, and
  SQLite reads `LIMIT -1` as unbounded, so a negative limit returned entire tables.
- **Audit log recorded every call as a success (medium).** The outcome was
  hardcoded and written before execution, so a failed probe left a clean trail.
- **Ambiguous credentials accepted (low).** Duplicate `Authorization` headers were
  first-wins rather than failing closed.

Hardening applied alongside:

- SQL identifier interpolation is allowlisted at runtime rather than trusted to
  caller discipline. Every site was safe by inspection; none was safe by
  construction.
- A secret-tracking gate fails the build if a key literal, PEM block, or database
  file is ever tracked, alongside `gitleaks` in pre-commit and CI.
