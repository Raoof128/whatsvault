"""First-run bootstrap: create the encrypted databases and their keys.

`connection.provision_db` and the migration runner both existed and were tested,
but nothing called them — every entry point used `open_existing`, which requires
databases that no code path could produce. This module is that missing path.

The one genuinely dangerous operation here is minting a database key. SQLCipher
keys are not recoverable, so provisioning a fresh key beside an existing database
file leaves that ciphertext permanently unreadable. `KeyStore.require` refuses to
regenerate for exactly this reason (INV-ATREST); init applies the same care one
level up, by refusing whenever a database exists without its key.
