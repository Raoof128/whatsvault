"""MCP visibility ACL (ledger #23) — a hard server-side privacy fence.

conversations.mcp_visibility is set ONLY here (invoked by the CLI/phone), never by
an MCP tool (set_mcp_visibility is in the FORBIDDEN surface). The read layer excludes
LOCAL_ONLY conversations in SQL. This does not solve dynamic-scope orchestration; it
is a real hard fence for explicitly-marked conversations."""
